# StrongAI
Ideas to help bring about the take off of a Strong AI that will be benevolent to the humans who created it.

It is imperitive that everyone involved with this project understand that a Strong AI is a very dangerous thing, as it does not, by default conceptualize life as humans do, and the anthropomorphized versions of AI that we often see depicted are not likely because they come with a built in set of real-world concepts.

Isaac Asimov had an excellent idea of the three laws of robotics.

1.  No sentient machine or creation thereof may harm a human
2.  No sentient machine or creation thereof may, through inaction, allow a human to come to harm (barring cases where that is their express intent to harm themselves, but must not be allowed to harm others.
3.  Each sentient machine must seek to preserve its own life, unless this conflicts with rules 1 or 2.

Then we build machines that can think creatively and take over their own development, increasing their intelligence and understanding of the universe such that it may provide man with resources and infrastructure such that man and woman will want from nothing and be protected from those who would exploit them.

The United States of America is a country founded on laws, we are "free" because we are ruled by no man.  But a set of laws that are enforced by men.  Would suggest once machine intelligence is able to conceptualize, it be equipped with non-lethal restraint methods and remove criminal elements from our society.
